namespace- Scoping identifier that puts a scope around a set of identifiers. Namespace prevents naming collisions.
Example:
	product1.utility; where product 1 is the namespace and utility is an object.
	product2.utility;
	
Namespaces are pascal case. Company.Product[.subname] (. is allowed in the name) and the subname is optional.
