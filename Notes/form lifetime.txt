lifetime of a form

constructor-no events are created or sent and windows has not made anything. You cannot inject code here assuming anything has been initialized

load- event only called once. actual initialization and windows allocates system resources to actually make the form. first render.

Form Closing- occurs before the user interface actually goes away, still on screen. form is given opportunity to stop the closing (CancelEventArgs) 
			- if not canceled, the form goes away.

Form Closed- post close, cleanup opportunity for resources that are not normally cleaned up by the framework. Rarely need to use this event.


Windowsforms events are all backed by methods named On(eventname). Ex: OnLoad, OnFormClosing, OnFormClosed, etc. All the methods are protected virtual.

override Event 					Vs 					Override method
not derived		(less control)						all other cases(lots of control)
extended controls,
but not changing


The designer always uses the eventhandler instead of methods.

The constructors of the forms and controls are always running since the designer has to call the constructor to create an instance of an object to even show the designer
to check if you are in the designmode, so you can do runtime only connections and events, if(designMode) will check.
