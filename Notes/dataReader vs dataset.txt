Datasets vs Datareader

Datasets:
all data/schema is returned.
Very expensive, slow.
Large Memory overhead dont use this if loading more than 1000 rows
All operations are defined
Designed for batch operations
built in

Datareader:
No schema information
Fast, inexpensive.
Read Only, cannot modify data inherently
Can stop the reading of data.
Not for designers/ui.
